<p>Artifacts must be packaged to ease evaluation and include an <a href="#artifact-appendix">artifact
appendix</a>. Packaging is not only about evaluation but about
future use of the artifact by other researchers who may want to build on top of
it or use it as a baseline. In addition, consider how you plan to distribute
your artifact.</p>

<p>Please see our <a href="tips">tips</a> page for insights on how to build great research
artifacts.</p>

<p>Finally submit your artifact and its appendix via HotCRP to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sec24summerae.usenix.hotcrp.com/">Summer</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://sec24fallae.usenix.hotcrp.com/">Fall</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://sec24winterae.usenix.hotcrp.com/">Winter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions about how best to package your artifact, contact the
AEC chairs.</p>

<p><em>Destructive Artifacts</em>: Some artifacts may attempt to perform malicious or
destructive operations by design. These cases should be boldly and explicitly
flagged in detail at artifact submission time so the AEC can take appropriate
precautions before installing and running these artifacts. Please contact the
AEC chairs if you believe that your artifacts fall into this category.</p>

<p><em>Camera-Ready Submission Instructions</em>: After an artifact evaluation concluded,
we will collect a camera-ready version of all artifacts receiving at least one
badge. This includes information about the artifact location, the appendix,
and similar supplemental material. The instructions will be shared via eMail
when the badge decisions are announced.</p>

<h2 id="packaging">Packaging</h2>

<p>Your artifact package must include an obvious “read me” document containing
suitable instructions and documentation. A tool without a quick tutorial is
generally very difficult to use. Similarly, a dataset is useless without some
explanation on how to browse the data. Please see the <a href="badges">badges</a> page for
more details on what the instructions should contain.</p>

<p>Authors should consider one of the following methods to package the software
components of their artifacts (although the AEC is open to other reasonable
formats as well):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Source code:</em> If your artifact has few dependencies and can be installed
easily on several operating systems, you may submit source code and build
scripts. However, if your artifact has a long list of dependencies, please use
one of the other formats below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Container/virtual machine:</em> We recommend using a format that is easy for
evaluators to work with, such as Docker images. In any case, the Dockerfile or
script used to initialize the virtual machine should be available. Consider
preparing the right toolchain and runtime environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Live instance on the web:</em> Ensure that it is available during the artifact
evaluation process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Internet-accessible hardware:</em> If your artifact requires special hardware
(e.g., SGX or another trusted execution environment), or if your artifact is
actually a piece of hardware, please make sure that evaluators can access the
device. VPN/SSH-based access to the device might be an option (in that case,
please provide the SSH private access key directly in your submission to
reduce time to gain access to hardware).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="artifact-storage">Artifact Storage</h2>

<p>Great artifacts are easy to find and stored for a long time. The archived copy
of the artifacts (necessary to qualify for the Artifacts Available badge) must
be accessible via a stable reference or DOI. For this purpose, we recommend
Zenodo, but other valid hosting options include institutional and third-party
digital repositories (e.g., <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>,
<a href="https://figshare.com/">FigShare</a>, <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash/">Dryad</a>,
<a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/">Software Heritage</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>. For
repositories that can evolve over time (e.g., GitHub), a stable reference to the
evaluated version (e.g., a URL pointing to a commit hash or tag) rather than the
evolving version reference (e.g., a URL pointing to a mere repository) is
required. Note that the stable reference provided at submission time is for the
purpose of Artifact Evaluation. Since the artifact can potentially evolve during
the evaluation to address feedback from the reviewers, another (potentially
different) stable reference will be later collected for the final version of the
artifact.</p>

<h2 id="artifact-appendix">Artifact Appendix</h2>

<p>The artifact appendix is a self-contained document which describes a roadmap for
evaluators. This includes a description of the hardware, software, and
configuration requirements, as well as the major claims made by the paper and
how to reproduce each claim through your artifact. Linking the claims of the
paper to the artifact is a necessary step that ultimately allows artifact
evaluators to reproduce your results. It is of foremost importance that you
state your paper’s key results and claims clearly. This is especially important
if you think that these claims differ from the expectations set up by your
paper. If possible, the appendix should also describe how to compare the results
of a reproduced experiment to the ones found in the paper (e.g., by providing
access to the underlying dataset of the results).</p>

<p>The intention for the artifact appendix is to be published in conjunction with
your artifact. A template for the artifact appendix can be found here: <a href="appendix/usesec23-ae-latex.zip">LaTeX
Template</a> and <a href="appendix/usesec23-appendix.pdf">PDF Example</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Artifact Appendices are recommended to be 3 pages max.</strong></p>

<h3 id="usenixbadgessty--affix-usenix-artifact-evaluation-badges">usenixbadges.sty — affix USENIX Artifact Evaluation badges</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usenixbadges</code> LaTeX style file affixes USENIX Artifact Evaluation badges to
the front page of a USENIX-formatted paper (or standalone Appendix). You must
use it to add badges to your final (camera-ready) artifact appendix. You may
also want to use it to add the badges to a self-hosted USENIX Security paper as
well (which we recommend having the artifact appendix appended at the
end). Download the <a href="appendix/usenix23-badges.zip">usenixbadges</a> package and follow the
instructions below.</p>

<h4 id="installation">INSTALLATION</h4>

<p>Put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usenixbadges.sty</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usenixbadges-*.pdf</code> graphics files in the
directory that contains the LaTeX source for your paper.  (Really, you can put
them anywhere in LaTeX’s search path, but the simplest thing is to put the files
in the same directory as your paper’s LaTeX source files.)</p>

<h4 id="usage">USAGE</h4>

<p>In the preamble of your LaTeX document, insert a line like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  \usepackage[&lt;options&gt;]{usenixbadges}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the options, list the badges that have been awarded to your paper. The
possible badges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">available</code>  — affix the “Artifacts Available” badge</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">functional</code> — affix the “Artifacts Functional” badge</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reproduced</code> — affix the “Results Reproduced” badge</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  %% Affix the indicated badges to the paper.
  \usepackage[available,functional]{usenixbadges}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Tips:</p>

<p>In your LaTeX document, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\usepackage[...]{usenixbadges}</code> directive must come
after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\documentclass</code> and before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\begin{document}</code>.</p>

<p>If your LaTeX document has many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\usepackage</code> directives, put
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\usepackage[...]{usenixbadges}</code> near the end of those.  This may avoid problems
relating to conflicting options for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">graphicx</code> package.</p>
