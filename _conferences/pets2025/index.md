title: Artifact Evaluation
order: 0

PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers.
This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build
on the work described in the papers. Artifact submissions are requested from
authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly
encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

Possible artifacts include (but are not limited to):

- Source code (e.g., system implementations, proof of concepts)
- Datasets (e.g., network traces, raw study data)
- Scripts for data processing or simulations
- Machine-generated proofs
- Formal specifications
- Build environments (e.g., VMs, Docker containers, configuration scripts)

Artifacts are evaluated by the artifact review committee. The committee
evaluates the artifacts to ensure that they provide an acceptable level of
utility. Issues considered include software bugs, readability of the
documentation, appropriate licensing, and the reproducibility of the results
presented in the paper. After your artifact has been approved by the committee,
we will accompany the paper link on
[petsymposium.org](https://petsymposium.org/) with a link to the artifact along
with the obtained artifact badges so that interested readers can find and use
your hard work.
