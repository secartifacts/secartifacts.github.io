title: Artifact Evaluation
order: 0
---

PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers.
This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build
on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from
authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly
encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

Possible artifacts include (but are not limited to):

- Source code (e.g., system implementations, proof of concepts)
- Datasets (e.g., network traces, raw study data)
- Scripts for data processing or simulations
- Machine-generated proofs
- Formal specifications
- Build environments (e.g., VMs, Docker containers, configuration scripts)

Artifacts are evaluated by the artifact review committee. The committee
evaluates the artifacts to ensure that they provide an acceptable level of
utility, and feedback is given to the authors. Issues considered include
software bugs, readability of documentation, and appropriate licensing. After
your artifact has been approved by the committee, we will accompany the paper
link on [petsymposium.org](https://petsymposium.org/) with a link to the
artifact along with an artifact badge so that interested readers can find and
use your hard work.
