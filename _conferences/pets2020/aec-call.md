## Artifact Submission Guidelines

For PoPETs 2020, we'll be doing a soft start with artifact reviews and will only
be performing very basic checks for the proper documentation, licensing, and
compilation of artifacts rather than doing an in-depth analysis of the source
code and the reproducibility of results in the paper. For all artifacts, authors
should submit the following:

- A copy of your paper or a brief description of how the artifact is relevant to
  it.
- A link to where the artifacts are publicly hosted.

For source code submissions, authors should additionally submit the following:

- Licenses that allow the code to be made public and used by other groups
  wishing to reproduce or build on the results.
- A build environment such as a virtual machine or a Docker container that has
  been configured with all the prerequisites necessary to build and run the
  code.
- If the code is interpreted, some simple inputs so that the reviewers can
  verify that the code runs. We want to make sure that the code will execute
  without error, not that the outputs are necessarily correct.
- A README or other documentation that describes how to build and/or run the
  code. Reviewers should be able to build compiled code in the provided
  environment by following instructions in a README or INSTALL file. For
  interpreted code, the program(s) should run without error on the provided
  inputs.

For dataset submissions, authors should additionally submit the following:

- Clear documentation that would allow researchers working on similar problems
  to re-use the dataset for their work.
- Optionally, data processing scripts.
