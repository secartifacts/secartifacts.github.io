A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the document itself, which is why WOOT organizes an optional artifact evaluation process, inspired by similar efforts in software engineering and security conferences.
