A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond
the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw
survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on.
In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the
document itself, yet many of our conferences offer no formal means to submit and
evaluate anything but the paper itself. To address this shortcoming, we are
running an optional artifact evaluation process, inspired by similar efforts in
software engineering and other areas of science. USENIX Security will run an
optional artifact evaluation process, inspired by similar efforts in software
engineering and other areas of science.
