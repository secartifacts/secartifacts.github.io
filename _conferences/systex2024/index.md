The 7th Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution [(SysTEX 2024)](https://systex24.github.io/) introduced an optional artifact evaluation phase for accepted papers, inspired by similar efforts in the security and systems communities.

The artifact evaluation was carried out by a dedicated volunteer [artifact evaluation committee (AEC)](https://systex24.github.io/committee.html#aec). The explicit focus was on providing constructive feedback and cooperatively improving the quality and reproducibility of any code or data research artifacts. This initiative aimed to add an optional "artifacts evaluated" [badge](badges) on the website, linking to the corresponding open-source repository. The presence of this badge not only acknowledges the commitment to open science by the authors but also enhances the visibility of these efforts.
