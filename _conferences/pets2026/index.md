PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers.
This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build
on the work described in the papers. Artifact submissions are requested from
authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly
encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

Possible artifacts include (but are not limited to):

- Source code (e.g., system implementation, proof of concepts)
- Datasets (e.g., network traces, raw study data)
- Machine-generated proofs
- Formal specifications
- Build environments (e.g., VMs, Docker containers, configuration scripts)
- User study questionnaires and aggregate, anonymized results

Artifacts are evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee. Issues considered
include software bugs, readability of the documentation, appropriate licensing,
and the reproducibility of the results presented in the paper. After your
artifact has been approved by the committee, the paper link on
[petsymposium.org](https://petsymposium.org) will be accompanied by a link to
the artifact along with the obtained artifact badges so that interested readers
can find and build upon your work.
