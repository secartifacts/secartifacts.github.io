title: Ethics and open science policy
order: 35
---

USENIX Security open science policy aims to enhance the availability, reproducibility, and replicability of scientific findings.
With this policy, it's mandatory for authors to share their research artifacts, such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. 
Ethics considerations and compliance with the open science policy must be discussed in the paper, each in its own section, immediately preceding the reference section. 

Non-compliance with the new open science policy (i.e., not sharing research artifacts publicly and permanently) will lead to the immediate rejection of the USENIX Security paper, even if the paper was (conditionally) accepted.
