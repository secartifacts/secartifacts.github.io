In pursuit of promoting open science and increasing the reproducibility of scientific studies in the security community, the [Call for Papers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity26/call-for-papers) for USENIX Security '26 an "Open-Science" policy. 
This policy **requires authors to share their research artifacts by default**, which an Artifact Evaluation Committee will then evaluate for _availability_. Optionally, these artifacts can also be assessed for _functionality and reproducibility_.

This site is set up to provide relevant information to authors and artifact evaluators about the artifact evaluation process. 
After the artifact evaluation, this website will document the evaluation results.

All major updates to the site content will be noted in the [Change Log](/usenixsec2026/change-log).
