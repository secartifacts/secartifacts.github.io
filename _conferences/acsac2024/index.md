To help support the reproducibility for research results, ACSAC encourages authors of accepted papers to submit software they develop and datasets they use to perform their research and make them publicly available to the entire community. We believe that this is an important initiative that can help the entire community increase its reputation, and make research in the security field proceeds faster by taking advantage of systems previously built by other researchers. We thank all the authors who participated in this initiative!
