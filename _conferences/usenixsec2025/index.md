In pursuit of promoting open science and increaseing reproducibility of scientific studies in the security community, the [Call for Papers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/call-for-papers) for USENIX Security 2025 initiated an "Open Science" policy. This policy requires authors to share their research artifacts by default which will then be evaluated by an Artifact Evaluation Committee for availability by default and optionally, for functionality and reproducibility. This site is set up to serve guidelines for authors, artifact evaluators and readers about artifact evaluation procedure. After the conclusion of artifact evaluation, this web site will serve as a placeholder for documenting the results of the artifact evaluation.

**Note**: This site will periodically undergoes changes which will be documented in the [Change Log](/usenixsec2025/change-log) for easier tracking.
