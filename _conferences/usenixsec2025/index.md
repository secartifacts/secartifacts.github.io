In pursuit of promoting open science and increasing reproducibility of scientific studies in the security community, the [Call for Papers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/call-for-papers) for USENIX Security 2025 initiated an "Open Science" policy. This policy requires authors to share their research artifacts by default which will then be evaluated by an Artifact Evaluation Committee for availability. Optionally, these artifacts can also be assessed for functionality and reproducibility. This site is set up to provide relevant information to authors and artifact evaluators about the artifact evaluation process. At the conclusion of artifact evaluation, this web site will also document the results of the evaluation.

All major updates to the site content will be noted in the [Change Log](/usenixsec2025/change-log).
