title: Call for AEC Members
order: 60
---


For the sixth year, USENIX Security allows the evaluation of artifacts that support a paper: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw measurement data, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. 

**New this year**: USENIX Security '25 has an "Open-Science policy" which mandates all authors to submit their accepted paper's artifacts for availability verification. So, to accommodate this, both cycles of the AE will be conducted in two phases (one phase for availability verification and one phase for functionality and reproducibility assessments), as discussed in the [Call for Artifacts](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/call-for-artifacts).

If you are interested in participating as an Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) member or would like to nominate someone, please fill out the form below. We expect that the AEC will consist of senior PhD students, postdocs, faculty, industry experts, and other researchers. The total workload is expected to be around 2 artifacts to assess (for AE functionality/reproducibility assessments) per submission cycle. In addition, a sub-committee of AEC members will be formed to help verify that all accepted papers publicly released their artifacts (for AE availability verification). This sub-committee can ask for a reduced review load (for AE functionality/reproducibility assessments) in lieu of their contributions (to AE availability verification). The AE chairs will provide more details about the timeline and process via e-mail. The AEC members are expected to serve for both review cycles for USENIX Security '25. 

As an AEC member, you will not only help promote the reproducibility of
experimental results in systems research, but also get to familiarize yourself
with research papers just accepted for publication at USENIX Security and
explore their artifacts. For a given artifact, you may be asked to evaluate its
public availability, functionality, and/or ability to reproduce the results from
the paper. You will be able to discuss with other AEC members and anonymously
interact with the authors as necessary, for instance if you are unable to get
the artifact to work as expected. Finally, you will provide a review for the
artifact to give constructive feedback to its authors, discuss the artifact with
fellow reviewers, and help award the paper artifact evaluation badges.


Overall, you will gain insights into a modern AE process, get mentoring and
guidance during the process, and get a chance to receive a Distinguished
Artifact Reviewer Award, granted to AEC members who have contributed with
outstanding efforts and constructive feedback to authors during the AE. The AEC members will also be publicly acknowledged on the main conference as well as this website.
