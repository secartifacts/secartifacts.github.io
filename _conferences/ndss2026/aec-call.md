title: Call for AEC Members
order: 40
---

We are looking for members of the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC), who will contribute to the [artifact evaluation](call) process of NDSS by reviewing submitted artifacts.

If you are interested in joining the AEC, please fill out the form below. We expect that the AEC will consist mainly of experienced graduate students and postdocs. Junior students and young faculty members are also welcome to apply.

The expected workload is 2 reviews (typically around 10-15 hours of work) for the Summer cycle and 2-3 for the Fall cycle. AEC members will serve for *both* cycles: please ensure that you have sufficient time and availability during the two evaluation periods (June 27th to September 9th 2024 and September 26th to December 2nd 2024).

As an AEC member, you will not only help promote the reproducibility of experimental results in security research, but also get to familiarize yourself with research papers just accepted for publication at NDSS 2025 and explore their artifacts.
For a given artifact, you may be asked to evaluate its public availability, functionality, and/or ability to reproduce the results from the paper.
You will be able to discuss with other AEC members and anonymously interact with the authors as necessary, for instance if you are unable to get the artifact to work as expected.
Finally, you will provide a review for the artifact to give constructive feedback to its authors, discuss the artifact with fellow reviewers, and help award the paper artifact evaluation badges.

Overall, you will gain insights into a modern AE process, get mentoring and guidance during the process, and get a chance to receive a Distinguished Artifact Reviewer Award, granted to AEC members who have contributed with outstanding efforts and constructive feedback to authors during the AE.

We expect that most evaluations can be done on your own computer (any moderately recent desktop or laptop will suffice). In other cases, authors will provide anonymous remote access to external facilities.
